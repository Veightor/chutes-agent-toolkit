description: "Make Chutes.ai available to any agent via MCP or cautiously-used OpenAI-like configs. Use this skill when the user wants to plug Chutes into Cursor, Cline, Aider, Claude Desktop, Hermes, or another agent. The skill installs the Chutes MCP server (stdio), writes per-agent config snippets, and runs a health check. Triggers on: MCP chutes, chutes MCP server, cursor chutes, cline chutes, aider chutes, claude desktop chutes, hermes chutes provider, openai-compatible chutes, drop-in chutes config, portable chutes, chutes for my agent."

# chutes-mcp-portability

> **Status: VERIFIED LIVE 2026-04-13** via `docs/chutes-maxi-wave-2.md` Track C.2 + C.6. `chutes-mcp-server --self-check` passed, and 7 read tools were exercised against a real `cpk_` with non-empty responses.
>
> **Read tools graduated out of BETA (verified):** `chutes_list_models`, `chutes_get_quota`, `chutes_list_aliases`, `chutes_list_chutes`, `chutes_get_usage`, `chutes_get_discounts`, `chutes_list_api_keys`.
>
> **Read tools still BETA (not exercised this pass):** `chutes_chat_complete` (paid), `chutes_get_evidence` (needs a specific chute_id), `chutes_oauth_introspect` (needs a live OAuth token).
>
> **Write tools — permanent BETA** under the deploy-features policy: `chutes_deploy_vllm`, `chutes_deploy_diffusion`, `chutes_teeify`, `chutes_set_alias`, `chutes_delete_alias`, `chutes_create_api_key`. The `set`/`delete` alias pair was functionally exercised live during wave 2 (round-trip passed) but stays BETA per policy — deploy-side writes always keep the label. MCP tool descriptions prepend `[BETA] ` so clients display it.

## What this skill does

Makes Chutes usable from **any** agent environment with one of two mechanisms:

1. **MCP server** (`mcp-server/server.py`). Stdio transport. Exposes Chutes management + inference as MCP tools. Any MCP-aware client (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Cline, Claude Code itself) can load it.
2. **Config snippets** (`scripts/generate_agent_config.py`). For clients that don't speak MCP but do speak OpenAI-like HTTP. Some of these are still conditional/experimental because many clients hardcode `Authorization: Bearer` rather than allowing `X-API-Key`.

Both paths read secrets from the keychain via `manage_credentials.py` and never echo `cpk_` into transcripts.

Wave-3 live auth finding (verified 2026-04-15):
- inference succeeded with `X-API-Key: cpk_...`
- Bearer auth with a `cpk_...` key returned 401 on the inference surface
- management endpoints worked with a JWT obtained from `POST /users/login` using the fingerprint

The MCP server in this repo now mirrors that split auth model locally.

## Supported targets

| Target | Mechanism | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Desktop | MCP | Writes to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS path; shown for other OSes) |
| Claude Code | MCP | `claude mcp add` equivalent or direct config snippet |
| Cursor | MCP | `.cursor/mcp.json` at the workspace root |
| Cline | MCP | VS Code `settings.json` MCP block |
| Aider | OpenAI-compat | `~/.aider.conf.yml` with `openai-api-base` + model allowlist |
| Hermes | OpenAI-compat | Updates `other-agents/hermes/` custom provider YAML |
| Generic OpenAI SDK | OpenAI-compat | Prints an env var block |
| System-prompt agents | prompt | Writes a paste-able instruction block to `other-agents/system-prompt/` |

## Walkthrough

### Step 1 — pick targets

Ask the user which targets to configure. Multi-select is normal ("Cursor and Aider").

### Step 2 — install the MCP server (for MCP targets only)

```bash
uv tool install chutes-mcp-server --from plugins/chutes-ai/skills/chutes-mcp-portability/mcp-server
# or:
pipx install plugins/chutes-ai/skills/chutes-mcp-portability/mcp-server
```

This gives the user a `chutes-mcp-server` command on PATH. The command reads `CHUTES_API_KEY` from env or falls back to `manage_credentials.py get --field api_key` for inference. For management tools, it uses `CHUTES_FINGERPRINT` or the stored fingerprint to mint a short-lived JWT via `POST /users/login`.

### Step 3 — generate configs

```bash
python <skill-scripts-dir>/generate_agent_config.py --target cursor,aider,hermes
```

`--target` accepts a comma-separated list. For each target, the script:

- Reads `cpk_` from the keychain to inject into env-var-style targets.
- Writes the config file to the target's conventional location (or prints a diff if the file already exists).
- Prints next-step commands (restart the client, reload window, etc.).

### Step 4 — health check

For MCP targets:

```bash
chutes-mcp-server --self-check
```

Runs `chutes_list_models` with `limit=1` against the live Chutes API over stdio transport. Prints OK + the first model id on success. This is the verification step that graduates read-only MCP tools out of BETA.

For OpenAI-compat targets, the script prints a one-liner `curl https://llm.chutes.ai/v1/models` that the user can run themselves.

## MCP tool surface

| Tool | Endpoint | Label |
|---|---|---|
| `chutes_list_models` | `GET https://llm.chutes.ai/v1/models` | read |
| `chutes_chat_complete` | `POST https://llm.chutes.ai/v1/chat/completions` (streaming) | read |
| `chutes_list_chutes` | `GET /chutes/` | read |
| `chutes_deploy_vllm` | `POST /chutes/vllm` | **[BETA]** write |
| `chutes_deploy_diffusion` | `POST /chutes/diffusion` | **[BETA]** write |
| `chutes_teeify` | `PUT /chutes/{id}/teeify` | **[BETA]** write |
| `chutes_list_aliases` | `GET /model_aliases/` | read |
| `chutes_set_alias` | `POST /model_aliases/` | **[BETA]** write |
| `chutes_delete_alias` | `DELETE /model_aliases/{alias}` | **[BETA]** write |
| `chutes_get_usage` | `GET /invocations/usage` | read |
| `chutes_get_quota` | `GET /users/me/quotas` | read |
| `chutes_get_discounts` | `GET /users/me/discounts` | read |
| `chutes_get_evidence` | `GET /chutes/{id}/evidence` | read |
| `chutes_oauth_introspect` | `POST /idp/token/introspect` | read |
| `chutes_list_api_keys` | `GET /api_keys/` | read |
| `chutes_create_api_key` | `POST /api_keys/` | **[BETA]** write |

Write tools prepend `[BETA] ` to the tool description string so the MCP client shows the label in the tool picker.

## Safety rules

- **Never write a raw `cpk_` into a generated config file.** Prefer env-var references (`${CHUTES_API_KEY}`) that the client resolves at runtime. If a target absolutely requires an inline key, warn loudly.
- **MCP tools never return `cpk_` through results.** The server reads the key at boot and uses it internally only.
- **Write tools require BETA label.** Do not remove the `[BETA] ` prefix from a write tool's description without a recorded verification run that exercised it.
- **Health check is not optional.** A skill completion without a successful health check stays BETA.

## Related skills

- `chutes-ai` (hub) — prerequisite credential setup.
- `chutes-deploy` **[BETA]** — write tools map 1:1 to deploy scripts; use the skill when the user wants an interactive walkthrough, use MCP when another agent needs programmatic access.
- `chutes-sign-in` **[BETA]** — `chutes_oauth_introspect` is the MCP-exposed form of the SIWC verify step.
